# football-rankings

This project aims to analyze and provide a ranking of the future potential of members of the 2017 NFL draft class based on regression techniques applied to past college players' statistics and their professional-level output. Though the predictive aspect of the process is based upon linear regression, the greater complexity of this project comes from the work done to wrangle, join, standardize, perform preliminary analysis on, and devise features from the unorganized and (frequently missing) data available. To produce a CSV file of rankings, run either of the R files, setting the working directory to the appropriate file path on the local drive. Make sure to unzip the CSV files and add them to the working directory.
